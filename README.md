# A Compiler and Optimization Passes for tinyL

This project consists of several parts:
- A recursive descent LL(1) parser that generates ILOC instructions
- A peephole optimization pass for constant folding
- A peephole optimization pass for operator strength reduction
- An optimization pass for dead code elimination
